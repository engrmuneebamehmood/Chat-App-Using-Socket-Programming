# Chat-App-Using-Socket-Programming
The aim of this project is to express how we can implement a simple chat application between
a server and a client using socket programming concept of computer networks.The application
is a desktop-based application. Application consists of two programs:
1) Server
2) Client
SERVER:
The server module of the application waits for the client to connect to it. Then if connection is
granted a client interacts communicates and connects to the server, it can mutually
communicate with the server. The duty of the server is to let clients exchange the messages.
CLIENT:
The client module is the one that utilizer sends requests to the server. Utilizer utilizes the client
as the means to connect to the server. Once he establishes the connection, he can communicate
to the connected server.
